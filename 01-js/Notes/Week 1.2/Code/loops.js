// Write A program that counts all the value from 0 to 10000 and prints it

let answer = 1+2+3+4+5+6;

console.log(answer)



// A slightly easy way of doing this

let answers = 0


answers = answers +1;//1
answers = answers +2;//3
answers = answers +3;//5
answers = answers +4;//10
let sum = 0 

for (let i =1 ; i< 1000; i++){
    sum = sum + i
}
console.log(sum)
