# HOW COMPUTERS WORKS

[![Slide 2](./Images/Slide2.png)](./Images/Slide2.png)

### Any application that you have on your machine that is vlc media player , zoom resides in the SSD but when you run something it runs in something called the RAM(Random Access Memory).

[![Slide 4](./Images/Slide4.png)](./Images/Slide4.png)

### The machine on the high level only understands 0s and 1s, what is finally going into the RAM are 0s and 1s

[![Slide 5](./Images/Slide5.png)](./Images/Slide5.png)

### Does that mean that the devlopers of vlc wrote 0s and 1s when they were riting the code of vlc.

[![Slide 6](./Images/Slide6.png)](./Images/Slide6.png)

### How does the opensource code of vlc gets converted into 0s and 1s using the compilers

[![Slide 7](./Images/Slide7.png)](./Images/Slide7.png)

## Any Application that you have on yoyr machine is going to be written in any of the languagnges like c, c++ , java , javscript , Golang , Rust the compiler converts them into0s nad 1s and runs in the RAM.

## Lets see this in action

### This program is supposed to print hello world on the screen

### Step 1= Write Code

[![Slide 10](./Images/Slide10.png)](./Images/Slide10.png)

### Step 2= Compile Code

### The G++ compiler compiles the code and converts it into 0s and1s

[![Slide 11](./Images/Slide11.png)](./Images/Slide11.png)

### Step 3= Run the code and put it into the RAM

### The temp file is simmilar to the Gta file you have on your machine, the temp file when it runs on the machine it prints helloworld

# BUT JAVASCRIPT IS DIFFERENT - INTERPRETED LANGUAGE

[![Slide 13](./Images/Slide13.png)](./Images/Slide13.png)

### The code is going line by line

### If there are 10 lines it wiil conver the first line to 0 and 1 and then go to the next line.

# Lets run console.log(a) without declaring a in JS you can do that in Javscript but not in C++ it will throw an error in c++

# What did we learn?

[![Slide 19](./Images/Slide19.png)](./Images/Slide19.png)

# Why JS > some other languages?

[![Slide 20](./Images/Slide20.png)](./Images/Slide20.png)

## Here what we are trying to do is in javascript we can redeclare a variable and assign some value to it, but we cannot do that in c++ it gives a compile time error

[![Slide 21](./Images/Slide21.png)](./Images/Slide21.png)

# Single Threaded Nature Of Javascript

[![Slide 22](./Images/Slide22.png)](./Images/Slide22.png)

## Whenever you buy a machine you check the number of cores , for example in the screenshot below MAC has total 10 cores

# What is a core?

## It means one single core can run 1 single file , for example zoom vs code is running on different cores

## If i run some JS code on my machine, like some node.js code of two different files it can`t run them both parallely it will run first one pehle then the second one.

[![Slide 24](./Images/Slide24.png)](./Images/Slide24.png)

# Java Golang helps you to split your code among different cores

# There are 3 ways to describe a variable in Javascript

## Let Var And Const

# Functions

## Abstract out logic in our program

## Take Argument as input

## Return a value as an output

## You can think of them as independent program that is supposed to do something given an input

## Functions can take other functions as input they will confuse you (callbacks)
